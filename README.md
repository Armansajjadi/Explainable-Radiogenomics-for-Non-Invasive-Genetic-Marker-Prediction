# Explainable-Radiogenomics-for-Non-Invasive-Genetic-Marker-Prediction
This project develops a proof-of-concept computational tool that leverages deep learning to predict critical genetic markers in brain tumors (specifically, IDH mutation status) from standard MRI scans. It integrates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, like Grad-CAM, to create a "glass box" diagnostic aid that visually highlights the specific tumor regions that influence its prediction. The goal is to demonstrate a trustworthy, high-impact application at the intersection of medical imaging, genomics, and AI for significant clinical and research potential.
