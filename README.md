# Explainable-Radiogenomics-for-Non-Invasive-Genetic-Marker-Prediction
A deep learning tool to predict brain tumor genetics (IDH mutation status) directly from MRI scans. Using Explainable AI (XAI), the model not only provides a diagnosis but also visually highlights the specific tumor regions that inform its decision, fostering trust and collaboration with medical professionals.
